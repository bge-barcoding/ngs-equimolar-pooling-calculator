# NGS Equimolar Pooling Calculator

A web-based tool for calculating equimolar pooling volumes for Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) library preparation.

## About

This calculator helps researchers determine the correct volumes to take from each pool when combining multiple NGS libraries for sequencing. It ensures that each individual sample contributes an equal number of molecules to the final sequencing run, resulting in more balanced coverage.

## Features

- Calculate equimolar pooling volumes for any number of input pools
- Support for both calculated and measured concentrations
- Option to maximize the usage of original pools
- Adjustable final volume
- Real-time results with detailed metrics
- Verification of equimolarity across samples

## Live Demo

The calculator is available at: https://bwprice.github.io/ngs-equimolar-pooling-calculator/

## Usage

1. Enter information for each input pool:
   - Molarity that each sample was normalized to (nM)
   - Total pool volume (Î¼l)
   - Number of samples in the pool
   - (Optional) Measured concentration from lab quantification

2. Choose whether to:
   - Use measured concentrations (if available from Qubit, Bioanalyzer, qPCR, etc.)
   - Maximize usage of original pools
   - Set a specific final volume

3. The calculator will automatically determine:
   - How much volume to take from each pool
   - The percentage of each pool that will be used
   - The final nM contribution per sample
   - Total samples in the final pool
